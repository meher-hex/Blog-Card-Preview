## Overview

This is a challenge where I have to design a blog card preview. It's been done using HTML & CSS.

## My process 

I tried to notice every little detail in the given design and made some notes like font family, size, etc. I went step by step, beginning with making divs. After creating a basic layout of all parts, I focused on making it similar to the design. As I fixed the size of the div, I moved to the image and then the text. At last, I moved the div to the middle and added the minor details.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google fonts

### Continued development

Rounding the corners of the SVG file was a new challenge to me. However, I failed to overcome it but I definitely got better with CSS.
